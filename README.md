# 🛒 E-Commerce Data Science Project

This project presents a technical assessment of an eCommerce business, focusing on customer behavior, marketing effectiveness, inventory management, and return analysis. The objective was to extract actionable insights and build predictive solutions to support data-driven decision-making.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze customer transactions and behaviors
- Evaluate sales performance across categories
- Assess marketing conversion across channels (Instagram, Google Ads, etc.)
- Identify key drivers behind high return rates
- Develop a predictive model to optimize inventory management

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🛍️ **Customer Segmentation**: High-value customers were identified based on frequency and monetary value of purchases.
- 💸 **Sales Drivers**: Top-performing products and categories contributing to the majority of revenue were highlighted.
- 📈 **Marketing Channels**: Conversion rates were mapped by source, with Google and Instagram performing best.
- 🔁 **Returns Analysis**: Found strong correlation between discount percentage and likelihood of returns in select categories.
- 🧠 **Inventory Forecasting**: A machine learning model was built to classify inventory based on stock level needs and reduce stockouts.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for EDA, visualization, and modeling
- **CSV Files** as input datasets
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost classifier for inventory prediction



## 📌 Deliverables

- ✅ Cleaned and structured dataset
- ✅ Visual analysis notebooks
- ✅ ML model for inventory classification
- ✅ Executive report with insights and recommendations

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Deploy inventory classifier as an API
- Integrate real-time data pipeline
- Automate monthly reports using Power BI or Dash
